# Pivoting, port forwarding and tunneling security laboratory.

Security lab showing the use of a compromised host to pivot into an internal network through the application of different tools. 
It is being developed as the final exam project for the Network Security course.

You can either play it on [DockerSecurityPlayground](https://github.com/DockerSecurityPlayground/DSP) platform or directly from your host by simply starting the containers in the docker compose provided.
